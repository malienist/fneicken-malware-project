## What is the Fneicken Malware Project (FMP)?

Python stuff that lets you query various open source computer security platforms from your terminal for information on malware or malicious domains.

The main reason for something like this to exist is to give you the ability to import information without having to manually visit these sources (their websites to be precise) individually. Other than making the entire initial triage process faster and easier, it will also allow you (or your frontline analysts) to quickly gather IOC, including C2i and use that information to push protective measures. 

## What resources are targetted?

To start with, I'm going with (surprise!) VirusTotal. It can process file hashes and domains to start with. I'll keep adding more functionality as we move forward. 

## What is planned for the future?

Any resource that allows API (that's pretty much all of them) and can be used in this project, will evntually end up here. Immediate focus, after VirusTotal is to get Shodan, Hybrid-Analysis (ok..., Falcon!), ThreatConnect and OTX.

## How can I get involved?

Just ask. You can contribute code, come up with new ideas and most importantly, fix my mistakes!
